## Requirements
* phpBB 3.1-dev or higher
* PHP 5.3 or higher

## Installation
You can install this on the latest copy of the develop branch ([phpBB 3.1-dev](https://github.com/phpbb/phpbb3)) by doing the following:

1. Copy the entire contents of this repo to to `FORUM_DIRECTORY/ext/forumhulp/pageaddon/`
2. Navigate in the ACP to `Customise -> Extension Management -> Extensions`.
3. Click Page Addon => `Enable`.
4. You can only install if Pages is already installed.

Note: This extension is in development. Installation is only recommended for testing purposes and is not supported on live boards. This extension will be officially released following phpBB 3.1.0. Extension depends on two core changes.

## Uninstallation
Navigate in the ACP to `Customise -> Extension Management -> Extensions` and click Page addon => `Disable`.

To permanently uninstall, click `Delete Data` and then you can safely delete the `/ext/forumhulp/pageaddon/` folder.
